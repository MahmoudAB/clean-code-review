# clean-code-review

## Chapter one

### What is bad code?

* Rushing = more bugs, not working to fix them => total disaster
* Long iterations to add new functionality
* Slow development => need to understand the code first
    * Productivity decreases, so management adds more people to try to understand the code lolz
    *	New team to redesign everything, both new old and new team are in a race, things are rushed again and cycle continues
    * Attitude problem, we bend to the will of managers to not risk being fired, we should act like **professionals** (Doctor example with the patient)
        * How to deal with when all the team bears the same attitude?
 
### What is clean code?

* School of thought, many people have different opinions, not one can claim to be right (Martial arts example)
* Uncle Bob will focus on how to make variable names, clean functions, clean classes, etc
* We are **Authors**, we should act according, expecting many people to read our code.
    *	Ration spent reading code vs typing code 10:1
    *	Languages are there for us to **UNDERSTAND** 
      
#### Boy Scout rule: **Leave the campground cleaner than you found it**
     Code needs to be kept clean over time
